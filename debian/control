Description: Plowshare drivers for various file sharing websites
 Plowshare is a framework for interacting with file sharing websites, providing
 an API to perform tasks like uploading and downloading files, and displaying
 CAPTCHAs to solve or sending them to CAPTCHA web services.
 .
 This package provides the drivers (called 'modules') for file sharing
 websites. Because these depend on (often undocumented) rapidly changing
 external web APIs, you may wish to manually update a copy in your home
 directory instead of or as well as using the versions in this package.
 .
